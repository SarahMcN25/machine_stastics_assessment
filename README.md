# Assessment: Machine Learning and Statistics

by Sarah McNelis

<br>

## Introduction

This repository is my MLS Portfolio containing jupyter notebooks for the module Machine Learning and Statistics (MLS) assessment as part of my Higher Diplomena in Computer Science Data Analaysis. 

<br>

## Setup

### Install the following:

1. Download and install [anaconda]().
2. Download and install [cmder]() if on windows.

<br>

### Running a jupyter notebook:

1. Open [cmder] terminal.
2. Run `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`on the command line.
3. The notebook should automatically launch in your browser. 
4. If not, then you may need to temporarily disable security software as some internet security can interfere with jupyter. 
5. Or you can copy the http link in cmder and paste into the url box of your browser. 
6. Once jupyter is open in your browser select which notebook you want to view. 
7. Once the notebook is open click on `kernal` on the tool bar and then `restart and run all`. 
8. Now the notebook is ready.

## What to expect

This repository contains a jupyter notebook named `anomaly-detection.ipynb`. This is a project based on Anomaly Detection using Keras. 

This repository also contains an `exercises` folder which is comprised of weekly exercises completed using jupyter notebooks. Each notebook contains tasks which are clearly marked and described within.
